# brewpal
A webapp to create and store homebrew recipes. Built with Django Rest Framework with postgreSQL and React

This is a personal project of mine that Im using to learn and explore new tools. It's not perfect and has some issues that Im working through as I develop. 

Current Priorities:
  * Add unit tests to all react code. 
  * Add unit tests to django code
  * Refactor current Redux implementation
  * Refactor current save serialization (add hops and yeast)
  * Implement a header bar
  * Implement get all recipes and UI to go with it
  * Allow Recipe Edit
  
**After Im done with adding unit tests to my existing code, I'll be completing this project using TDD. The current implementation started out as a prototype that has grown too far.**

This README will be updated as I go. This is still a couple months from production ready so install instructions are TBD
