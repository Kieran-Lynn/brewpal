# brewpal
A webapp to create and store homebrew recipes. Built with Django Rest Framework with postgreSQL and React

This is a personal project of mine that Im using to learn and explore new tools. It's not perfect and has some issues that Im working through as I develop. 

Current View:

  * Add unit tests to django code
  * ~~Refactor current Redux implementation~~
  * ~~Refactor current save serialization (add hops and yeast)~~
  * Implement a header bar
  * ~~Implement get all recipes and UI to go with it~~
  * Restyle the Recipe page
  * Allow Recipe Edit
